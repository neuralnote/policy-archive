    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        <b>What is the application?</b>
        <br />
        neuralnote.io is an AI-powered personal notebook and interactive
        knowledgebase builder that can help you explore almost any topic of
        interest in an organised way, allowing you to ask questions, take
        notes, form checklists, and more.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>What does the application do?</b>
        <br />
        neuralnote.io integrates with OpenAI to provide you with a personal
        space for you to:
        <ul>
          <li>Create pages (and bookmark them)</li>
          <li>
            Ask questions to receive structured AI responses about a topic
            or question. When a structured response is added to your page,
            it will often highlight various concepts within the response as
            hyperlinks that you can click on to drill down further into a
            particular concept. Clicking on a hyperlink will create a new
            nested page that explores the selected concept further (and will
            often contain its own hyperlinks). This allows you to explore a
            topic in a top-down fashion, automatically building a
            knowledgebase for you about a particular topic through a tree of
            nested pages.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can also ask questions to receive free-form AI responses
            that post to your current page. These generally won't contain
            hyperlinks, but they allow you to interact in a more free-form
            way.
          </li>
          <li>
            You may also add notes and smart checklists to your pages.
          </li>
        </ul>
        More features are on the way!
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>What are the benefits of using the application?</b>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            With AI, you can co-create personal knowledgebases allowing you
            to explore almost any topic
          </li>
          <li>
            You can maintain an online notebook of your thoughts, and plan
            projects by building out pages with notes, checklists, and AI
            generated posts
          </li>

          Why is it necessary to agree to the Terms of Use before using the
          application?
        </b>
        <br />
        It is required to agree to our Terms of Use to create an account on
        the Platform. This is because our Terms of Use outline the important
        rules and guidelines that govern your use of the Platform. By
        accepting our Terms of Use, you are legally agreeing to abide by
        these rules, which ensure a safe and fair experience for all users.
        Additionally, our Terms of Use protect both you and our Company by
        clarifying responsibilities and outlining possible consequences for
        misuse of the platform.

          What are some of the possible risks associated with using the
          application?
        </b>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Data loss</b>
            <br />
            As the User, it is important to be aware of the risk of data
            loss. This can occur due to various reasons such as technical
            glitches, third-party interference or natural disasters. In such
            an event, any data that you have uploaded or stored on the
            Platform may be lost permanently. It is crucial to keep a backup
            of any essential information as the Company is not liable for
            any loss of data.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Data breach or hacking</b>
            <br />
            Data breach or hacking is a risk that you should be aware of
            when using our services. This can happen when your personal
            information is accessed by unauthorized individuals, which can
            lead to identity theft, financial fraud, or other harmful
            outcomes. We make every effort to protect your data, but we
            cannot guarantee that our systems will always be completely
            secure. To minimize this risk, we recommend that you use strong
            passwords, limit the amount of personal information you share on
            the Platform, and monitor your account regularly for suspicious
            activity.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Downtime or server failure</b>
            <br />
            You should be aware that there is a risk of downtime or server
            failure that may occur on our Platform. This could be caused by
            various factors such as system upgrades or maintenance, security
            breaches, or unexpected technical problems. In the event of such
            incidents, our Platform may not be accessible, and you may not
            be able to access certain features or services. We will do our
            best to minimize any downtime and promptly address any server
            issues that may arise, but we cannot guarantee uninterrupted or
            error-free access to our Platform.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Malware attacks</b>
            <br />
            Malware attacks are a risk that you should be aware of when
            using our Platform. This type of attack involves malicious
            software that can harm your computer, steal your personal
            information, or cause other undesirable effects. You should take
            steps to protect yourself, such as keeping your antivirus
            software up to date and not clicking on suspicious links or
            downloading unknown files. We are not responsible for any damage
            caused by malware attacks, so it is important that you take
            these precautions to ensure the security of your device and
            personal information.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>
              Unauthorized access to sensitive information by employees,
              hackers, or third-party vendors
            </b>
            <br />
            You acknowledge the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive
            information by employees, hackers, or third-party vendors. This
            risk could potentially result in the compromise of your personal
            information, including but not limited to your name, address,
            phone number, email address, and payment details. As such, you
            agree to take reasonable precautions to protect your personal
            information, such as using strong passwords and refraining from
            sharing your login credentials with others. You also acknowledge
            that the company is not responsible for any loss or damage that
            may result from unauthorized access to your personal
            information.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Third-party data theft or misuse</b>
            <br />
            As a user, you should be aware of the risk of third-party data
            theft or misuse. This means that any personal information you
            provide on our Platform or through our services could
            potentially be stolen or used inappropriately by another party.
            While we take all necessary precautions to protect your data, we
            cannot guarantee that it will always be safe from cyber attacks
            or other security breaches. It is important that you take steps
            to protect your own information, such as creating strong
            passwords and not sharing sensitive details where possible. By
            using our Platform, you acknowledge and accept this risk.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Denial of Service (DoS) attacks</b>
            <br />
            The site may experience Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. This
            type of attack is when a hacker floods the site's servers with
            excessive traffic or requests, causing them to overload and shut
            down. This can make the site temporarily unavailable, disrupting
            your experience and potentially causing frustration or
            inconvenience. While we take precautions to mitigate such
            attacks, they are not always avoidable.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Unintended data disclosure</b>
            <br />
            Unintended data disclosure can occur if data is accidentally
            shared with others, such as posting confidential information on
            a public forum. This can compromise the privacy and security of
            your personal and confidential data, and can result in serious
            consequences such as identity theft or financial fraud. You can
            reduce this risk by taking extra precautions about what data you
            share with the Platform and where it is shared.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>User error or malfeasance</b>
            <br />
            As a user of the site, you should be aware that there is a risk
            of user error or malfeasance. This means that you or another
            user could unintentionally cause harm to the site or its users
            by making mistakes or engaging in unethical behavior. Some
            examples of user error or malfeasance include posting
            inappropriate content, sharing confidential information, or
            violating the Platform's Terms of Use. To mitigate this risk, it
            is important to carefully review these Terms of Use and
            guidelines, and to report any suspicious or concerning activity
            to the site administrators immediately at{" "}
            <a href="mailto:contact@neuralnote.io">contact@neuralnote.io</a>
            .
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>System vulnerability exploitation</b>
            <br />
            As a user of our site, you may be at risk of system
            vulnerability exploitation. This means that cybercriminals may
            attempt to take advantage of weaknesses or flaws in our systems
            and gain unauthorized access to your personal information or our
            network. These vulnerabilities could be the result of outdated
            software, misconfigurations, or other security oversights. It is
            important to note that we take extensive measures to prevent
            such attacks, but there is always a chance that they may occur.
            As a user, you should take precautions like using strong
            passwords, and take care to avoid posting sensitive data to the
            Platform.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Phishing attacks</b>
            <br />
            One of the risks you may face as a user of this Platform is
            phishing attacks. This is when scammers try to trick you into
            giving them your sensitive information, such as login
            credentials or credit card details, by posing as a trustworthy
            entity through email or other forms of communication. Be wary of
            suspicious emails or links and always verify the sender's
            identity before sharing any sensitive information.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Ransomware attacks</b>
            <br />
            As a user of our Platform, you should be aware of the risk of
            ransomware attacks. These attacks involve hackers gaining access
            to your computer and encrypting your files, demanding a ransom
            in exchange for the decryption key. If you fall victim to a
            ransomware attack, you may lose access to your personal or
            sensitive information, and may have to pay a significant sum to
            regain control of your files. It is important for you to take
            necessary precautions, such as regularly backing up your data
            and avoiding suspicious emails or downloads.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Insecure payment transactions</b>
            <br />
            We use <a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a> as our payment
            processor. Stripe is certified as a PCI Level 1 service
            provider, the most stringent level of certification available in
            the payments industry. Sensitive payment card information is
            sent directly from you to Stripe and is not received by us. When
            you create a subscription, your card is saved on file with
            Stripe. Our platform is able to charge the card on file,
            creating a risk that hackers could obtain access to the platform
            and use that card on file for for fraudulent purposes, resulting
            in financial loss for you. We recommend monitoring your bank
            statements and reporting any suspicious activity immediately.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Defamation or damage to brand reputation</b>
            <br />
            As a user of the site, you risk the possibility of defamation or
            damage to your brand's reputation. This can occur if sensitive
            information is exposed or if incorrect or inaccurate content
            obtained from this site is shared externally. It is important to
            be wary of any information received from the site and take
            measures to protect your brand's image.

          <p>
            <b>Information required</b>
            <br />
            When reporting a violation, please provide as much information
            as possible to aid in the investigation. Some helpful
            information may include the date and time of the incident, the
            identities of the parties involved, and any relevant
            screenshots, links, or documentation. Additionally, please
            provide a brief description of the violation and any supporting
            evidence.

            <b id="reporting-violation-confidentiality">Confidentiality</b>
            <br />
            We take all reports of violations seriously and will keep your
            identity confidential to the greatest extent possible. We will
            only share the reporter's identity and contact information with
            select employees on a need-to-know basis. However, in some
            cases, we may be required by law to disclose your identity or
            other details related to the violation. We will inform you if we
            need to disclose your identity or details related to the
            violation, except where prohibited by law. We will limit
            disclosure to those individuals who need to know in order to
            investigate and respond to the reported violation. We expect
            that reporters will also maintain confidentiality and refrain
            from sharing any information related to the report with anyone
            outside of the reporting mechanism. Any breach of
            confidentiality by the reporter will be treated as a violation
            of this Agreement and may result in suspension or termination of
            the reporter's account. Further, we may reach out to and discuss
            specific violations with the reported User, while keeping your
            identity confidential to the fullest extent possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Response Time</b>
            <br />
            We strive to respond to all reported violations as soon as
            possible. Our response time may vary depending on the nature and
            complexity of the reported violation. In general, we aim to
            acknowledge receipt of the report within 7 days and provide a
            resolution or update on progress within 30 business days.
            However, the actual response time may be longer or shorter than
            these estimates. We appreciate your patience and understanding
            as we work to address any reported violations.

            prior violations or other factors we deem relevant. We reserve
            the right to modify or increase penalties depending on the
            severity or frequency of the violation. The extent of penalties

            content, AI-generated content, third party content, user
            activity logs, and interviewing involved parties. We may also
            cooperate with law enforcement or other third parties in the
            investigation. The length and extent of the investigation will
            depend on the nature and severity of the reported violation. We

            confidential and respect the privacy of users involved, except
            as necessary to enforce the Usage Policy or comply with legal
            requirements. We may also take measures to prevent future
            violations of this policy. During our investigation, we may
            suspend your account or restrict your access to the Platform
            where necessary. Please cooperate with us and provide accurate

          <b>Password Requirements</b>
          <br />
          To ensure the security of your account, you need to set up a
          strong and unique password. Your password must be at least 8
          characters long and include a combination of upper and lower case
          letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid using easily guessable
          information like your name, email address, birthdate, or any other
          personal information in your password. Also, do not reuse the same
          password across multiple systems. Please keep your password
          confidential and do not share it with anyone. We recommend
          changing your password regularly to further enhance your account
          security. If you believe that your password has been compromised,

          the latest security updates and virus protection installed. It is
          your responsibility to ensure that the devices you use to access
          our Platform are free of malware and viruses. If you lose your
          device, log in to the Platform from another device you own and go
          to your user settings, deactivate other login sessions, and change
          your password. If you suspect that one of your devices has been
          lost, stolen, or compromised in any way, you should immediately
          cease using that device to access our Platform and notify us of
          the problem. We also recommend that you log out of your account
          when you are finished using our Platform on a shared device, to
          prevent unauthorized access by others. Failure to comply with the
          device management guidelines may result in unauthorized access to

          This includes creating a strong and unique password, regularly
          updating your password, properly managing your devices, promptly
          reporting any unauthorized access to your account, and maintaining
          the confidentiality of your login credentials. We strongly
          recommend that you refrain from sharing your login credentials
          with others or using easily guessable passwords. Remember, your
          account security is your responsibility.

          <b>Data Encryption</b>
          <br />
          As an important measure to protect your personal information, our
          Platform uses industry-standard encryption technology to secure
          your data. This means that any information you provide, including
          your password and personal details, is transmitted using advanced
          encryption algorithms which make it unreadable to unauthorized
          parties. The data for your account is stored at rest on drives
          encrypted using strong encryption. We constantly review and update
          our encryption methods to ensure a high level of security for your
          data. However, please note that no system can be completely
          secure, and we strongly advise you to take all necessary
          precautions to protect your account from unauthorized access.

          <b>Account Recovery</b>
          <br />
          In the event that you forget your password or believe that your
          account has been compromised, you may initiate the account
          recovery process by clicking on the 'Forgot Password' link on the
          login page. You will be prompted to enter your registered email
          address, and a verification code will be sent to your registered
          email address to confirm your identity. Once you have verified
          your identity, you may reset your password and regain access to
          your account. It is important to choose a strong password that is
          difficult to guess and unique to your account. In case you are
          unable to access your registered email or phone number, you may
          contact us (see{" "}
          <a href="#contact-information">Contact Information</a>) for
          assistance in recovering your account. Note that during the
          account recovery process, we may ask for additional identity
          verification or temporarily suspend your account to prevent any
          unauthorized access until your identity is confirmed.

          or expenses we incur as a result of your non-compliance including
          but not limited to attorneys' fees, court costs, and any other
          reasonable expenses that may arise. We may seek to be reimbursed
          through legal action, which may include seeking reimbursement for
          our costs and attorneys' fees incurred in enforcing our rights. We
          also reserve the right to suspend, terminate, or restrict your use
          of the Platform if we believe that you have violated any of these
          provisions. You acknowledge that these remedies are necessary and
          reasonable in order to protect our business interests and maintain

          <b>User Responsibility</b>
          <br />
          As a user, it is your responsibility to exercise caution when
          accessing third-party links from our Platform. You should ensure
          that any link you follow is reliable and safe before accessing it.
          Furthermore, you should take steps to protect your personal
          information and computer system when using third-party links. You
          should carefully review the website's terms of use and privacy
          policy before providing any personal information or engaging in
          any transactions. Additionally, you should immediately report any

          By taking these precautions, you can help protect both yourself

          You understand and agree that we reserve the right to suspend or

      <h3>Dispute Resolution</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          <b>Negotiation</b>
          <br />
          In the event of any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to
          this Agreement or the use of our Platform, you agree to first
          contact us and attempt to resolve any dispute or claim informally
          through good faith negotation with us before pursuing any legal
          action or arbitration. You agree to send us a written notice
          describing the nature of the dispute and your proposed resolution
          to the following email address:{" "}
          <a href="mailto:contact@neuralnote.io">contact@neuralnote.io</a>.
          We will attempt to honor any reasonable request for resolution of
          a dispute and will make reasonable efforts to work with you to
          find a solution to the issue at hand prior to initiating any
          formal legal process. If you and the Company cannot come to a
          resolution through negotiation, you may proceed with other methods
          of dispute resolution outlined in this section.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Mediation</b>
          <br />
          If you have a dispute with the Company, we encourage you to first
          try to resolve the issue by contacting us directly. If the issue
          cannot be resolved through direct communication, we will attempt
          to mediate the dispute through Mediation. Mediation is a
          voluntary, confidential process where both parties work with a
          neutral third party, called a mediator, to find a mutually
          agreeable resolution. You and the Company will each choose a
          mediator and the two chosen mediators will select a third mediator
          to conduct the mediation. It is your responsibility to participate
          in good faith in the mediation process and to abide by the
          mediator's decision. If you refuse to participate in mediation or
          you or the Company do not comply with the mediator's decision, you
          and the Company may proceed to arbitration or other forms of
          dispute resolution.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Arbitration</b>
          <br />
          If negotiation and mediation fail to resolve the dispute, any
          remaining dispute or claim relating to these terms, the Platform,
          the Company, or its services will be resolved through binding
          arbitration rather than in court. The arbitration will be
          conducted in accordance with the rules of the Canadian Arbitration
          Association (CAA) and you agree to abide by their rules. The
          arbitration will take place in Canada, and the language of the
          arbitration will be English. The cost of arbitration will be
          shared equally by both parties, unless the arbitrator determines
          that the allocation of costs is unequal, in which case the
          arbitrator will allocate the cost of arbitration in a manner that
          is fair and appropriate under the circumstances. You understand
          and agree that the arbitrator's decision will be final and binding
          on both parties and that you waive the right to participate in or
          commence any class action lawsuit or class-wide arbitration. You
          understand and agree that any dispute must be brought within one
          year to arbitration after it arises or it will be barred forever.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Limitation of Liability</b>
          <br />
          You acknowledge and agree that the total liability of the Company
          and its affiliates, successors, assigns, employees, agents,
          directors, officers and shareholders, for any and all claims,
          damages, losses or liabilities arising out of or related to your
          use of the Platform shall not exceed the amount paid by you, if
          any, to the Platform for the use of its services within the past
          twelve months. In no event shall the Platform or its affiliates,
          successors, assigns, employees, agents, directors, officers or
          shareholders be liable to you or any third party for any indirect,
          consequential, special, punitive, or incidental damages or losses
          (including, without limitation, damages for loss of business, loss
          of profits or investment, goodwill, use, data, or other intangible
          losses), whether based on breach of contract, tort (including
          negligence), product liability, or otherwise, even if they have
          been advised of the possibility of such damages. The limitation of
          liability shall apply to the fullest extent permitted by law in
          the applicable jurisdiction. Please carefully review this section
          and consider these limitations of liability before using the
          Platform.

          determination of the scope or applicability of this Agreement to

          legal action or proceeding against the Company must be initiated
          and filed solely in a court of competent jurisdiction located
          within Ontario, Canada. You waive any objection to venue in any

          grounds, and waive objection to personal jurisdiction in such
          court over you. You further agree that you will not challenge the

          should survive termination shall survive termination, including,
          without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers,
          indemnity and limitations of liability.
